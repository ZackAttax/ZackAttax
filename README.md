Software engineer proficient in Ruby💎, JavaScript🟨, and React⚛️. Coding is something I've always been curious about, and now I'm discovering just how much I enjoy things like debugging and backend development. Throughout my career I've worked in a variety of environments where I've enjoyed problem solving, working with my hands, and becoming more efficient in my tasks. I've been delightfully surprised to discover software engineering is at the intersection of my skills, experience, and most exciting of all, emerging talent. I'm loving it and the community I'm now both a member of and contributor to.

In the future, I'd like to take my unique experiences, my curiosity for how stuff works, and my new skills in programming to work with like-minded people who love what they do.

On a personal note, I enjoy pursuing a number of hobbies including camping🏕, mountain biking🚵‍♂️, roasting coffee☕️, exploring local street art👨🏼‍🎨, and finding the best fried chicken🍗 in town.
